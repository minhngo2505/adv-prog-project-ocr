# Persona: Jack Thomson 

## Background
Jack Thomson  is enrolled at TAFE for a programming diploma.

Grew up in the suburbs, except for summers with his grandparents in a small wheatbelt town of Merridin. 
In school, showed interest in maths and history.  He particularly loved using computers, as they served as a gateway to the world.   
  At first, screen-readers enabled him to read any well-built website.  But the growth of mobile -oriented, over-javascripted websites caused frustration.
    Jack became proficient using screen readers, and gained an interest in how the computers worked. He learned to write macros and small scripts to solve small problems.   
Family encouraged him to "learn to code".  

## Goals
Jack sometimes listens to Youtube videos on coding, but it can be frustrating when they depend on sight for code examples.
He wants to be able to make better use of these, as some information is not easily found by other means.

## Needs
Jack needs to have code samples and other text in the video extracted easily, so it can be read aloud by his screen-reader.
